## Summary ##
Well hello there updates.

This repo has undergone significant modifications to make it into a better tool for exploring instancing, rather than just a mash-up of examples.

As a tool this project will now start in perform mode and allow you to explore examples, read about how they're constructed, and open the network to see how you might create a similar result.

To use this repo effectively, please clone or download the whole repo. Extract the contents to a location on your computer, and launch the toe file called `instancingTechniques.toe`.
