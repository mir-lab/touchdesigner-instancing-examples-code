# Examples
Wowza!

How time forever marches on.

After a year of experimenting with this presentation format, it's finally made sense to transition this repository away from holding an explorer toe file and all of the examples. That's challenging to support, and in the long run just means that the time and effort that might be spent on making more examples, instead gets swallowed by maintenance for the distribution structure. 

For that very reason, this repo is transitioned to only hold instancing example code. You'll now just find tox files here that are individual examples.

## Upgrades

A generalized resource navigator now lives in this repo:  
* [TouchDesigner Navigator](https://github.com/mir-lab/touchdesigner-resource-navigator)

The Navigator operations similarly to the previous `TOE` file, only it now can be directed to web pages that support resource examples and documentation. This provides a number of benefits for operation, maintenance, and longevity. 

The documentation for all examples `TOX` files in this repo are moved over to another docs only repo hosted by github pages. You can find all the documentation pages here:
